# ImageHawk

A way for action photographers to sell their work easily.

ImageHawk is an app where photographers can upload their photography a


The idea was born while surfing in Pavones. There is a great surf photographer here who takes drone videos and still photos of surfers. He's known as @cocodrone. He got a few cool shots of me and I wanted to buy the phtos from him.

In order for me to get the photos, I had to search the town for him. Once I found him, I followed him back to the hostel and he airdropped the photos to me. I paid him with a combination of PayPal and cash.

My guess is that this photographer would make more sales if this delivery process was easier. He could put up a sign that says, "Got to imagehawk.app/cocodrone to see photos of you!".

The surfers who are hoping to see images of them surfing could visit his site and check the date in which he uploaded the photos. If they find one they want to buy, they can click the downgraded, pixelated image, put it in their cart and complete the purchase.

That way Coco can spend more time taking photos and the surfers can get their images faster!
