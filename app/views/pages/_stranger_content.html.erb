<p>Image Hawk is a service that allows photographers to sell their photography in a better way.</p>
<!--<p>Make money with your action photography work.</p>-->
<!--<p>Here's an example of your business:</p>-->
<!--<p>You take photos of surfers from the beach.</p>-->
<!--<p>The surfers want to buy the high-resolution photos you took.</p>-->
<!--<p>When they get out of the water, you give them a card and say, "I got some great photos of you. You can check them out here".</p>-->
<!--<p>That card has your ImageHawk address on there.</p>-->
<!--<p>Later that day, you upload your work to ImageHawk.</p>-->
<!--<p>The surfer can see low resolution images and pick the ones they want. They pay via credit card online and the high-resolution photos are automatically sent to them.</p>-->
<!--<p>You get paid via direct deposit, PayPal or it can be converted to Bitcoin and moved to your wallet.</p>-->
